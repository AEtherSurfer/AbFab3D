ShapeJS is a language designed to make creating and sharing 3D printable objects easy.  Based on Javascript,
it provides a rich set of solid modeling primitives over top a powerful voxel engine.  The combination
enables control of 3d printed objects down to printer resolution levels.  The voxel approach has many advantages
over typical triangle systems and aligns well with how 3d printers actually manufacture items.
Scripts include a parameter definition to allow interactive exploration of interesting
variants via an automatically generated user interface.  The script, current parameters and any external
resources can be saved into a simple transmittal format that others can easily load.

These docs describe the new ShapeJS 2.0 system.  ShapeJS 2.0 is a major overhaul of the original ShapeJS system.
Core to this release is a focus on creating real time responses.  We've been prototyping several creators
on the Shapeways site to prove out this point.  Check out the Pendant Creator, Ornament Creator and Audio
creators for examples of what's possible.
</p>
We developed ShapeJS to serve two primary communities: makers and creator creators.  In the maker community
OpenSCAD has shown the way in a simple but powerful scripting language for creating physical objects.  They
married a scripting engine to a powerful CAD kernel.  For many makers this emphasis on a programming approach
to 3D modeling resonated well.  ShapeJS is similar in concept with a few significant differences.  It is based
on a voxel kernel instead of a triangle one and itâ€™s built on a common programming language(Javascript), which is complete
and used all over the world by millions of people.

To avoid a holy war I won't detail the differences too much here.  Most 3D printers work by adding together
small bits of material into a complete object.  Using triangles to describe these voxels makes the code more
difficult and harder to allow for print resolution accuracy.  ShapeJS and the accompanying editor is designed
to make creating 3D printable objects fast and easy.  Using voxels avoids the most common reasons that
3d prints fail.  Currently if you download a triangle model from most 3d repositories they typically must
be repaired before printing.  This is because it's very hard to write triangle code that retains the mathematical
rigor necessary for 3d printing.  ShapeJS will always generate manifold and oriented models that can be 3d printed.
For these reasons we felt that writing a new language was warranted and would in the end prove valuable in the maker's
toolbox.

The second community we wanted to target is are people who want to write object creators
for others to use.  We call them "Creator Creators" and we see them as a necessary enabler for 3d printing to be
usable by humanity at large.  A natural progression when developing an object is to parameterize its function.
Similar to software an object gains features during it's development.  These parameters allow the object to be
used in a wider context and meet more peoples needs.  A natural tendency is to want to share your creations with
others.  Now that many people have 3D printers at home and access to many more through printing services its
become feasible to share the design for an object and expect others to be able to make it.  ShapeJS provides
a development environment to create those parameterizable objects and a way to share those designs with others.

<p>
Roughly speaking the value of each voxel represents the percent of this voxel volume occupied by the shape.
More precisely speaking the voxel value is appropriately normalized limited range signed distance function -
distance from voxel center to the shape surface. 
That value is represented internally by default with 8 bit precision which is equivalent to 256 different levels. 
This more precise representation greatly enhances the quality of generated objects in comparison with more traditional binary values of 0 and 1.
The gain in quality is similar to those of grayscale image over black and white image of the same resolution. 
</p>
<p>
The voxel based representation gives ShapeJS greater flexibility in shape generation over traditional representation via triangle meshes.
It is similar to advantages 2D raster graphics has over 2D vector graphics. Vector graphics is great for drawing diagrams and raster 
graphics is on practice the tool of choice for anything else. 
</p>
<p>
The way to fill the voxel grid is to create an object with <span class="code">DataSource</span> interface, 
which can calculate signed distance function for each point in space.  This object is fed to an instance of <span class="code">GridMaker</span> 
which controls the calculations. 
The distance function calculations may be very complex task for complex object. But this calculation can be simplified by 
composing complex object from many simpler one using several simple operations. 
</p>
<p>
There are several predefined simple object like <span class="code"><a href="#Sphere">Sphere</a></span>,<span class="code"><a href="#Box">Box</a></span>,
<span class="code"><a href="#Cylinder">Cylinder</a></span> and <span class="code"><a href="#Cone">Cone</a></span>.
More complex methods include functionality to convert 2D image to a 3D embossed object using <span class="code"><a href="#ImageBitMap">ImageBitmap</a></span> object and
importing user provided 3D object using <span class="code"><a href="#load">load()</a></span> function.
</p>
<p>
The real power of volume sculpting is in the flexibility of combining and transforming objects represented as distance function.  
There are usual boolean operations on objects which include <span class="code">Union</span>, <span class="code">Intersection</span>, 
<span class="code">Subtraction</span>, <span class="code">Complement</span>. 
</p>
<p>
There is a flexible set of transformations which can be applied to any <span class="code">DataSource</span> object. Transformations include standard
3D linear transformations like <span class="code"><a href="#Rotation">rotation</a></span>, <span class="code"><a href="#Translation">translation</a></span>, <span class="code"><a href="#Scale">scale</a></span>,
<span class="code"><a href="#PlaneReflection">reflection</a></span>. Flexibility of using volume based data allows to use arbitrary non linear transformation among those are
<span class="code"><a href="#RingWarp">RingWrap</a></span>, <span class="code" ><a href="#SphereInversion">SphereInversion</a></span>, <span class="code"><a href="#FriezeSymmetry">FriezeSymmetry</a></span>,
<span class="code">WalPaperSymmetry</span>, <span class="code">ReflectionSymmetry</span>. Several 
simple transformations can be composed into more complex transformation using <span class="code"><a href="#CompositeTransform">CompositeTransform</a></span>.
A transformation can be applied to any DataSource object via its <span class="code">setTransform()</span> method. 
</p>


<H2 id="Scripts">ShapeJS Scripts</H2>
<p>
ShapeJS Scripts are Javascript programs over top the AbFab3D Voxel library. All standard Javascript functionality is
supported.  In particular we use the Rhino Scripting engine in Java.  You can find the project documentation here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rhino_documentation" >Rhino Documentation</a>
</p>
<p>
Below is a simple ShapeJS program.
<pre class="code">
function main(args){  // this script will make a sphere

    var radius = 5*MM;        // radius of sphere 5 millimeters
    var voxelSize = 0.1*MM;   // size of grid voxel
    var gw = radius*1.1;      // make the grid size a little larger to have some clearance 
	
    var grid = createGrid(-gw,gw,-gw,gw,-gw,gw,voxelSize); // create the grid 
	
    var maker = new GridMaker();            // create instance of grid maker
    maker.setSource(new Sphere(radius));    // gives GridMaker object to work on 
    maker.makeGrid(grid);                   // GridMaker fills the grid with data 

    return grid;   // return the grid for final processing 
}
</pre>
<p>
    Click <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=sphere" target="_blank">Simple Sphere</a> to run this example.
</p>
<p>
All vss scripts should have function <span class="code">main(args)</span>. This function is executed by the ShapeJS scripting engine.
It is possible to pass arbitrary arguments (including uploaded files ) to the main(args), but we will explain this later. 
</p>
<p>
Unit of length in ShapeJS is <b>meters</b>.
To avoid awkward numbers there are few useful conversion constants MM=0.001 for millimeters, IN=0.0254 for inches. 
</p>

<p>
The primary object of ShapeJS script is a volumetric grid. The result of executing <span class="code">main(args)</span>should be a grid filled with scene data.
The scripting engine converts the grid returned by main() into a traditional triangle mesh which is sent back to the browser
and displayed in the 3D view.  
</p>
<p>
The grid is created via this function: <br><span class="code">grid = createGrid(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, voxelSize);</span>
</p>
Here the <span class="code">xmin, xmax ...</span> are the physical bounds of grid in the space. They define minimal and maximal coordinates where the final shape will be located.
The last parameter <span class="code">voxelSize</span> is the size of grid voxel. It defines the resolution of volume rendering. 
A Voxel size of 0.1 millimeter corresponds to the printing resolution of most 3D printers in 2013. This parameter greatly affects speed
of all calculations and the best approach is to keep it larger (0.2mm or 0.3mm) during script development and set to printer resolution only
at the final stage.
</p>
<p>
The primary tool of ShapeJS is <span class="code">GridMaker</span>. GridMaker fills the grid voxels with values calculated by objects called
<span class="code">DataSource</span>. <span class="code">Sphere</span> is one of several prebuilt data sources.
Users can also create new DataSource objects directly in their script.
</p>
<p>
Calling <span class="code">maker.makeGrid(grid)</span> does the actual calculations of the grid. Returning that grid from main initiates 
the ShapeJS engine conversion of grid data into a triangle mesh which is returned to browser.
</p>
<h2>Controlling parameter of output mesh</h2>
<p>
There are few variables which allow user to control behavior of volume sculpting engine. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshSmoothingWidth</span> Width of gaussian smoothing of the grid before conversion to traingle mesh. 
The width is given relative the grid voxel size. Default value is 0.5. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshErrorFactor</span> is maximal errod allowed during mesh decimation (reducing mesh complexity). It is given relative to voxel size. 
default value is 0.5. Smaller value greatly increase the resultng mesh complexity. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="code">meshMinPartVolume</span> allows to filter out sand size particles from the resulting mesh. All parts of volume less than 
meshMinPartVolume are discarded. This volume is specified in meters<sup>3</sup>. Default value is 1*MM3 (one cubic millimeter). 
</p>
<span class="code">meshMaxPartsCount</span> specifies the maximum number of parts to save.  The n largest parts are kept.  By default
all parts are retained.

<H2 id="Examples">Examples</H2>
<h3>Boolean Operations</h3>
<p>
In this example we'll show a powerful modeling technique creating objects by using boolean algebra.  Many objects can be described
by adding and subtracting primitive shapes from them.  In this example we create a cool doodad by subtracting a 3D cross from
a sphere.  Try the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=subtraction" target="_blank">Boolean Example</a>
</p>
<pre class="code">
function cross3D(size, thickness){
  var union = new Union();
  var boxX = new Box(0,0,0,size,thickness, thickeness);
  var boxY = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, size, thickeness);
  var boxZ = new Box(0,0,0,thickeness, thickeness,size);
  union.add(boxX);
  union.add(boxY);
  union.add(boxZ);
  return union;
}

function main(args) {
  var size = args[0];
  var thickness = args[1];
  var grid = createGrid(-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,-16*MM,16*MM,0.1*MM);
  var diff = new Subtraction(new Sphere(15*MM), cross3D(size, thickness));
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(diff);
  maker.makeGrid(grid);
  return grid;
}
</pre>
<p>
This script takes two parameters, the size of the cross and its thickness.  The 3D cross is created by unioning together
3 boxes.  The boxes are aligned in the x,y and z planes.  The source for the grid is the Subtraction of a Sphere and the
result of the cross3D function.
</p>
<h3>Image Popping</h3>
<p>
One of the nice features of using Voxel grids is the ability to use 2D raster image data.  In this example we'll take
an image and turn it into a 3D object.  Here we use an ImageBitMap source and give it a physical size.  We'll place
this object on both sides to create a mirror image.
</p>
<p>
Notice we changed the voxelSize in this example from the typical .1mm default.  When dealing with greyscale images you'll
likely want higher resolution to get smooth transitions between heights.
</p>

Run the example here: <a href="http://volumesculptor.com/creators/volume_sculptor/?example=image" target="_blank">Image Popper</a>
<pre class="code">
var voxelSize = 0.05*MM;

function makePart(path, width, height, thickness){
  var img = new ImageBitmap(path, width, height, thickness);
  img.setBaseThickness(0.0);
  img.setVoxelSize(voxelSize);
  img.setBlurWidth(2*voxelSize);
  img.setImagePlace(ImageBitmap.IMAGE_PLACE_BOTH);
  return img;
}

function main(args) {
  var image = args[0];
  var x = 10*MM;
  var y = 22*MM;
  var z = 3*MM;
  dest = createGrid(-x,x,-y,y,-z,z,voxelSize);
  var th = 2*MM;
  var width = 12*MM;
  var height = 40*MM;
  var img = makePart(image, width, height, th);
  var maker = new GridMaker();
  maker.setSource(img);
  maker.makeGrid(dest);
  return dest;
}
</pre>
<p>
    The ImageBitMap may have optional solid base. In this case we set base thickness to be 0, which in effect eliminates the base. 
The base thickness is 	given as fraction of the ImageBitMap object thickness. For example, setBaseThickness(0.4) will make ImageBitMap 
base thickness equal to (0.4*thickness) and the thickness of image will be reduces to 0.6*thickness;
</p>
<p>
Another useful method of ImageBitMap is setBlurWidth(blurWidth). The blurWidth is given in physical units and should normally be of the same size as 
voxelSize. The blurring eliminates sharp edges in the image. 
</p>

<H3>Creating your own Creators</H3>
The underlying engine for the web examples can be used in your own Javascript creator.  Once you have a script you like then we'd
encourage you to make a user-interface that's more specific and easier to use.  Once you have the parameters ready then you
can use a REST call to execute_pipeline that will generate the 3D model.  With this model you can easily use the rest of the
Shapeways API to store the models, get pricing and add your own markup to the models.

<h3 id="Custom DataSource">Custom DataSource</h3>
You can create your own DataSource inside ShapeJS scripts.  A DataSource must implement the getDataValue function.  This function
will evaluate the data source at a pnt.  This function should return signed distance to the objects surface.
Signed distance is positive for exterior points, negative for interior points and zero at the surface. To obtain high quality surface
the signed distance funtion should be properly normalized to voxel size. See example for a Sphere:
<pre class="code">

    importPackage(Packages.abfab3d.util);

    var radius;

    var Sphere = {
       getDataValue : function(pnt, data) {
          var x = pnt.v[0];
          var y = pnt.v[1];
          var z = pnt.v[2];

          var vs = pnt.getScaledVoxelSize();

          var r = r = Math.sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z);
          data.v[0] = MathUtil.step10(r, radius, vs);

          return DataSource.RESULT_OK;
       }
    }

    function main(args){
       radius = 5*MM
       var a = radius*1.1;
       var voxelSize = 0.1*MM;

       var dest = createGrid(-a,a,-a,a,-a,a,voxelSize);

       var maker = new GridMaker();
       maker.setSource(Sphere);
       maker.makeGrid(dest);

       return dest;
    }
 </pre>
